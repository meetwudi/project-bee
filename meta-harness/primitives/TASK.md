# Task

A task is an outcome-oriented execution contract.

Tasks live in a Library. The Library points to the place that contains the task definition.

A task is selected by source Library and task identity. Paths are only implementation details discovered after resolving the Library.

## Shape

Project-specific tasks use this shape:

```text
harness/tasks/
  AGENTS.md
  {task-name}/
    AGENTS.md
    TASK.toml
```

`TASK.toml` defines the task.

## Definition

`TASK.toml` includes:

- name
- source Library reference
- purpose
- Library references to read
- procedure checklist
- outcome checklist
- completion evidence

Use `library://{library-name}` references, not paths:

```text
library://project-harness
library://meta-harness
library://task-memory
```

Memory fields may point inside a Memory Library:

```toml
per_execution_memory_library = "library://task-memory/{task-name}/executions/"
cross_execution_memory_library = "library://task-memory/{task-name}/common/"
```

## Execution

A task execution:

1. Resolve the task's source Library through Library discovery.
2. Follow that Library's own discovery docs to the task representation.
3. Read the task-local instructions and task definition.
4. Verify the task definition's `source_library` matches the selected Library.
5. Resolve and read referenced Libraries.
6. Use configured Memory Libraries when present.
7. Complete procedure items and check outcomes.
8. Record completion evidence.
9. Promote durable learning to task memory when applicable.

A task is done when required procedure, outcomes, memory handling, and completion evidence are complete, blocked, or not applicable.
