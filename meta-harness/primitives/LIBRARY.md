# Library

A Library is a governed place that agents may explore.

A Library may point to a repository folder, local folder outside the repo, cloud knowledge base, database, private notes, CMS, website, documentation portal, API, or another knowledge source.

The Library index says where the place is. The place itself carries the knowledge.

Libraries organize knowledge, including tasks, memory, compliance, and checklists.

## Shape

Project-specific Library discovery belongs under `harness/libraries/`:

```text
harness/libraries/
  AGENTS.md
  LIBRARIES.toml
  LIBRARIES.local.toml  # ignored when present
```

`AGENTS.md` explains Library discovery. `LIBRARIES.toml` is the checked-in index. `LIBRARIES.local.toml` is ignored and may add private or machine-local Libraries without weakening checked-in governance.

## Index

Each Library entry points to one place:

```toml
[[libraries]]
name = "meta-harness"
primitive_kind = "library"
location = "meta-harness"
relative_to = "current-git-repository"
```

Required fields:

- `name`
- `primitive_kind`
- `location`

`relative_to = "current-git-repository"` means the location is relative to the nearest Git repository root.

When `relative_to` is omitted, `location` is an absolute location or an external location understood by the agent or tool that uses it.

## References

Reference a Library by name:

```text
library://{library-name}
```

Examples:

```text
library://meta-harness
library://project-harness
library://task-memory
```

A Library reference selects a place to explore. The index does not enumerate that place's contents.

## Primitive Kind

`primitive_kind` tells agents what kind of harness primitive the Library primarily carries.

Initial kinds:

- `library`
- `compliance`
- `task`
- `memory`
- `reference`

A broad place such as `library://meta-harness` may contain several primitive kinds. Use `primitive_kind = "library"` and let the place's own files guide exploration.

## Memory

Task memory should normally live in a local or external memory Library, not in the repository.

A task may create or organize a memory Library when no suitable local Library exists. Register it in `harness/libraries/LIBRARIES.local.toml`; do not create repository memory by default.

## Governance

Library governance belongs either in the Library entry or in the place it points to.

Compliance content still requires explicit human approval for obligation changes.

Agents must follow the selected Library's governance before updating knowledge.
