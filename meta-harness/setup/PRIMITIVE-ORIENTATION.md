# Primitive Orientation

Read this before working in a Meta Harness-managed project.

Meta Harness is knowledge-first. AI is the runtime that reads, follows, and updates knowledge under human rules.

Libraries are where knowledge lives. A Library points to a place. The agent explores that place through its own files, tools, and instructions.

Some knowledge is a primitive:

- Library: a governed place to explore.
- Task: a countable unit of execution with required outcomes.
- Memory: agent-usable knowledge carried across time.
- Compliance: human-approved rules that govern work.
- Checklist: explicit checks used to verify procedure, outcomes, and compliance.

The primitives compose:

- Tasks read Libraries.
- Tasks may update Libraries when allowed.
- Tasks use Memory without needing every task to restate that Memory exists.
- The default local task Memory Library is `library://task-memory` when registered.
- Tasks use Checklists to make procedure and outcomes verifiable.
- Compliance applies to work and uses Checklists for evidence.
- Libraries organize all of these primitives.

When starting work, first discover the relevant Libraries, then identify applicable tasks, memory, compliance, and checklists.
